### Security
Data held in sales pipelines are considered to be highly confidential and sensitive.  The primary advantage of this approach is that most tenants have clear regulatory frameworks around Sharepoint and Office 365.  By deploying mindfully into Sharepoint, you may inherit the governance policies set by your organization.  Governance is even more simplified when the standard practice is to deploy each pipeline into its own dedicated site.  Read below for further, focused resources on security, data protection, compliance and best practices.
